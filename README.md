The idea to find corresponding trends between any related attributes as well as distribution patterns of metrics across the varied set.
For decision makers to take actions, it is required to carry out univariate, bivariate and categorical analysis on some of the key attributes that are identified and represent them visually with relevant information.Also , some information is required for key questions

3.	Show a bivariate analysis between Salary and hour_per_week.Choose a plot of your choice. Mention the inferences drawn  

4.	For each Education type , showcase the distribution of Salary .Use Seaborn Facetgrid & Line plot.Identify the key observations and mention them

5.	Categorizing each Gender & Relationship status (combination of all values) , plot the hours_per_week worked.Choose appropriate plots.Mention the inferences drawn
